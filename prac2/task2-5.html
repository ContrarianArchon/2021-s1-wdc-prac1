        <h1>A page with divs and spans</h1>
        <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
        <p>Because this div is special, it has it's own ID, "content".<br>This differentiates it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span> <span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of "cursive",</span> because they belong to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
